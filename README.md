- Install R and the package,[vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html).
- Install Pandas by running the following command in a Python environment: pip install pandas.
- Save the dowlonaded [Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org) in the /cgi-bin/EDNAMAPscripts100 directory.

## Deployment and Maintenance

### uWSGI Restart Script

To restart the uWSGI server and clear Python cache files, use the provided script:   
bash restart_uwsgi.sh   
This script performs the following steps:   
Deletes all .pyc files in the project directory.   
Stops uWSGI using the PID file (/tmp/eDNAmap.pid) if it exists.   
Kills any remaining uWSGI processes as a fallback.   
Restarts uWSGI using the wsgi.ini configuration file.   
Log output can be checked at /var/log/uwsgi/eDNAmap.log.
